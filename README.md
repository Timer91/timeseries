A good-looking way to get an overview of several aired TV series between 2004 and 2020.

- Timeline stretchs from `2005` to `2020`
- Seasons `width` equals to `one episode per week * number of episodes`
- Seasons are placed at `first aired date`
- Series are sort by its `last seasons aired in time`
- Responsive design with `window.resize`
- The 3px white vertical line is the `current time` set with `Date.now()`
